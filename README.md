# AminoOS
The Amino OS is an architecture for share computing resources within a stable and efficient environment. Through the evaluation of existing technical architectures for sharing computing resources and the utilisation of our own accumulated technology, we developed and integrated a state-of-the-art architecture that we call the Amino OS. We continue to constantly innovate and optimise the architecture in terms of performance, stability, compatibility, and security to provide a cutting-edge architecture for sharing computing resources.  In the Amino OS whitepaper, we evaluate the current commonly used technical architectures that share computing resources and assess their respective advantages and disadvantages as well describing the motivation and innovation behind the Amino OS.
